This is a Disease Insight project

Abstract:
This project introduces a web application for disease prediction, leveraging the Streamlit framework. The application integrates machine learning models trained on diverse health datasets to predict the likelihood of specific diseases. The supported diseases include Diabetes Prediction, Heart Disease Prediction, Liver Disease Prediction, Lung Cancer Prediction and Chronic Kidney Prediction.The application features an intuitive user interface with interactive widgets, enabling users to input relevant health information. Utilizing machine learning models loaded through joblib, the system processes these inputs to predict the presence of diseases. Predictions are presented alongside essential details, probabilities, and, in certain cases, precautionary measures. The rising prevalence of diseases worldwide necessitates the development of efficient and accessible tools for early prediction and prevention. This abstract introduces a web application built using Streamlit, a Python framework for creating interactive data applications, to facilitate disease prediction through advanced machine learning models. The application integrates user-friendly interfaces, real-time data processing, and predictive analytics to empower users with personalized insights into their 
health risks. This system serves as a suggestion system to doctors and the health industry for the  treatment of the patient, and any subsequent actions regarding the treatment are completely the responsibility of the doctors. The customer will be able to figure out how likely it is that using the signs and symptoms of a disease and predicts whether they have the disease or not in positive or negativecases. This disease insight uses models like Random Forest , Ada-Boost , XG-Boost , KNN , Logistic Regression.
